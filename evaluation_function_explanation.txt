# Evaluation Function for Red-Blue Nim

#> Overview
The evaluation function is a critical component of the MinMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta
pruning implemented in the Red-Blue Nim game. It assesses the desirability of a game
state from the perspective of the AI (computer player), helping it to make decisions
that maximize its chances of winning according to the rules and strategies specific to
the standard and misère versions of the game.

#> Function Design
The evaluation function calculates a score based on the current state of the game,
considering the number of red and blue marbles left. The scoring logic is designed to
reflect the strategic goals of the two game versions:

- Standard Version: The objective for the AI is to force the opponent (human player) to
                    take the last marble. Therefore, game states that lead the game closer
                    to this condition without actually causing the AI to lose are rated
                    more highly. The score is calculated as the negative sum of 2 times the
                    number of red marbles plus 3 times the number of blue marbles, encouraging
                    the AI to reduce the number of marbles in a way that aligns with winning
                    strategies for Nim.
  
- Misère Version: The goal is inverted; the AI aims to avoid taking the last marble. In this
                  case, the scoring favors game states that leave an even distribution of marbles,
                  making it harder for the game to end quickly and increasing the chances that the
                  human player will be forced into a losing move. The score is, therefore, the
                  positive sum of 2 times the number of red marbles plus 3 times the number of blue
                  marbles, encouraging the preservation of marbles when possible.

#> Strategic Considerations

The evaluation function incorporates several key strategic considerations:

1. Priority of Marble Colors: The different values assigned to red and blue marbles (2 and 3,
                              respectively) take into account the varying points lost or gained when
                              they are left in the game at the end. This differential scoring helps
                              the AI prioritize which marbles to target for removal based on their
                              impact on the game's outcome.

2. Adaptability to Game Version: By adjusting the sign of the score based on the game version, the
                                 function remains flexible, allowing the AI's strategy to adapt
                                 dynamically to the conditions for winning or losing specific to each
                                 version.

3. Depth Awareness: Although the basic evaluation function does not directly incorporate depth, the
                    design allows for easy integration with a depth-limited search strategy. This
                    future enhancement would enable the AI to consider not just the immediate but
                    also future implications of moves, further refining its strategy.

# Conclusion

The evaluation function is designed to guide the AI in making decisions that enhance its chances of
winning according to the nuanced objectives of the Red-Blue Nim game's two versions. By carefully
considering the game state and aligning the scoring with strategic goals, the function plays a pivotal
role in enabling the AI to compete effectively against human players.
